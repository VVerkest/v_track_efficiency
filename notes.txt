compare statistics from pythia 8 to pythia 6 statistics (by bin)
	--> compare: pt dist, charged constituents (NEF)
	(more neutral particles in pythia 6 because of fewer decays)

LIMIT PYTHIA EFFICIENCY TRACKING TO CHARGED PARTICLES

produce pt distributions for each bin


//////////////////

6-5-17

pt and number difference on jet-by-jet basis
number of constituents without efficiency, multiplicity statistical dist
add back particles accordingly with either p6 or p8 (to 1st order equivalent)

turn on decays again! use Pythia8 "right out of the box"

p6->p6+geant      pt resolution at higher pt
